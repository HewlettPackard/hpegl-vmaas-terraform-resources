# Resource hpegl_vmaas_instance

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

`hpegl_vmaas_instance` resource supports instance creation as well cloning an existing
instance.

-> It is mandatory to choose the `template_id` while creating the instance of type 'vmware'
(for this purpose `hpegl_vmaas_template` can be used). If not, an error will be returned. This mandation
does not apply for other instance types (no error will be prompted in this case).

For creating an instance please refer following examples.

~> Volume name should be unique. An error will be prompted if the volume name is repeated.


## Example usage for creating new instance with only required attributes

{{tffile "examples/resources/hpegl_vmaas_instance/minimal.tf"}}

-> `power` attribute is supported for `hpegl_vmaas_instance`, but only `poweron`  operation is supported
    while creating.

## Example usage for creating new instance with all possible attributes

{{tffile "examples/resources/hpegl_vmaas_instance/all_options.tf"}}

You can also create instance by cloning from an existing instance. To do so use `clone` attribute
and provide `source_instance_id`.


Cloned instance can have all the possible attributes (same as create new instance). The only difference will be
the additional `clone` attribute.

~> On cloning an instance `port` attribute will not be presented while cloning an instance.

# Resource hpegl_vmaas_instance

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

`hpegl_vmaas_instance` resource support instance creation as well cloning an existing
instance.

-> It is mandatory to choose the 'template_id' while creating the instance of type 'vmware'
(for this purpose `hpegl_vmaas_template` can be used). If not, an error will be returned. This mandation 
does not apply for other instance types(no error will be prompted in this case).

For creating an instance please refer following examples.

~> Volume name should be unique. No error will be prompted if the volume name is repeated, but 
unexpected behavior can be expected, during instance update.


## Example usage for creating new instance with only required attributes

{{tffile "examples/resources/hpegl_vmaas_instance/minimal.tf"}}

-> `power` attribute is supported upon creating an instance. But only `poweron`  operation is supported
    while creating an instance.

## Example usage for creating new instance with all possible attributes

{{tffile "examples/resources/hpegl_vmaas_instance/all_options.tf"}}

You can also create instance by cloning from an existing instance. To do so use `clone` attribute
and provide `source_instance_id` along with it

~> While cloning an instance you need to make sure that the Primary volume and Primary Network should
  be the same as the **parent instance**. Terraform will not return any error but cloning an instance with
  updated Primary volume/Network may result parent instance goes into failed state

Cloned instance can have all the possible attributes (same as create new instance). The only difference will be
the additional `clone` attribute.

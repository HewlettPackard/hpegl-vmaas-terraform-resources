# Resource hpegl_vmaas_load_balancer_monitor

-> Compatible version >= 5.4.6

{{ .Description | trimspace }}
`hpegl_vmaas_load_balancer_monitor` resource supports NSX-T Load balancer Monitor creation.

For creating an NSX-T Load balancer Monitor, use the following examples.

-> NSX-T Monitor having HTTP,HTTPS,ICMP,Passive,TCP,UDP  considered as different monitor types. You can create either HTTP,HTTPS,ICMP,Passive,TCP,UDP, but not everything at the same time.

-> Load Balancer ID Data Source `hpegl_vmaas_load_balancer` is supported for Creating Monitor.


## Example usage for creating NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for HTTP with all possible attributes

-> For NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for HTTP creation, attribute monitorType value `LBHttpMonitorProfile` is applicable only HTTP creation.

-> Once NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for HTTP created with `LBHttpMonitorProfile`, we can not modify the attribute during the update operation and its disabled from UI.

## Example usage for creating NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for HTTPS with all possible attributes

-> For NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for HTTPS creation, attribute monitorType value `LBHttpsMonitorProfile` is applicable only HTTPS creation.

-> Once NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for HTTPs created with `LBHttpsMonitorProfile`, we can not modify the attribute during the update operation and its disabled from UI.

## Example usage for creating NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for ICMP with all possible attributes

-> For NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for ICMP creation, attribute monitorType value `LBIcmpMonitorProfile` is applicable only ICMP creation.

-> Once NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for ICMP created with `LBIcmpMonitorProfile`, we can not modify the attribute during the update operation and its disabled from UI.

## Example usage for creating NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for Passive with all possible attributes

-> For NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for Passive creation, attribute monitorType value `LBPassiveMonitorProfile` is applicable only Passive creation.

-> Once NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for Passive created with `LBPassiveMonitorProfile`, we can not modify the attribute during the update operation and its disabled from UI.

## Example usage for creating NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for UDP with all possible attributes

-> For NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for UDP creation, attribute monitorType value `LBUdpMonitorProfile` is applicable only UDP creation.

-> Once NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for UDP created with `LBUdpMonitorProfile`, we can not modify the attribute during the update operation and its disabled from UI.
